Use script.py to run the code.

Don't forget to download the dependencies:

1. Pygame:
```pip install pygame```

2. PIL (Python Imaging Library, now known as Pillow):
```pip install Pillow```

3. Tkinter (Tkinter is included with Python by default, so you don't need to install it separately. However, you may need to ensure that you have the tkinter package installed if you're using Python 3.x):
```pip install tk```
